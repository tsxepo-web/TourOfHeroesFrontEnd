## Interfaces
* Dependancy Inversion principle says that higher level components should depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.
* Interfaces are abstract functions that relays data from services to the presentation layer.
* [IHeroRepository](https://github.com/tsxepo-web/TourOfHeroesBackendApi/blob/master/HeroesDAL/Interfaces/IHeroRepository.cs) for the databases.
* [IWeatherService](https://github.com/tsxepo-web/TourOfHeroesBackendApi/blob/master/HeroesWeatherService/Interface/IWeatherService.cs) for the weather services.

## Presentation Layer UI
Angular is used for the front end.

## Cloud
* Azure Static Web App is used to host the frontend.
* Azure App Services is used to host the backend.
* Azure Cosmos DB is used to host data.
* Github Workflows is used for CI/CD and Actions to track the deployments.
